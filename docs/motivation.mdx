# Motivation

A lot of documentation implementations come with all the batteries
included. For large, ambitious projects those can be great fits.
However, for smaller projects, like `gatsby-theme-documentation` itself,
it can be preferable to use something more minimal to start.

With `gatsby-theme-documentation` all you have to do is write
Markdown for your sidebar and header, then edit a `theme.js`
file which handles all the styling.

That's it.

Down the road, if your project's needs change, you can look behind the
curtains and you have all of Gatsby at your disposal.
